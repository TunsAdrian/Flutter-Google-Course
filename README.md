# Google atelierul digital pentru programatori 2020

The purpose of this repository is to publish all the homeworks for Google Flutter Course. A new branch is created for each of the homeworks. So far, the following homeworks were done:


1. [Currency Converter](https://github.com/TunsAdrian/Flutter-Google-Course/tree/Currency-Converter) application with hardcoded value, from EUR to RON.

2. [Number Shape](https://github.com/TunsAdrian/Flutter-Google-Course/tree/Number-Shape) application that checks if a whole number is a perfect square, a perfect cube or both.

3. [Guess My Number](https://github.com/TunsAdrian/Flutter-Google-Course/tree/Guess-My-Number) application that generates a number between 1 and 100 and lets the user guess the number.
