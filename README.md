# Google atelierul digital pentru programatori 2020

The purpose of this repository is to publish all the homeworks for Google Flutter Course. A new branch is created for each of the homeworks. So far, the following programs were written:

1. [Laboratories Tasks](https://github.com/TunsAdrian/Flutter-Google-Course/tree/laboratories-tasks) application with 2 tasks:
   - first task was to fetch a JSON file with movies from https://yts.mx/, parse it and print its content in the terminal
   - second task was to fetch a list with the flags of the world names and images and to show them in a GridView

2. [Currency Converter](https://github.com/TunsAdrian/Flutter-Google-Course/tree/Currency-Converter) application that converts currency using a hardcoded value, from EUR to RON.

3. [Number Shape](https://github.com/TunsAdrian/Flutter-Google-Course/tree/Number-Shape) application that checks if a whole number is a perfect square, a perfect cube or both.

4. [Guess My Number](https://github.com/TunsAdrian/Flutter-Google-Course/tree/Guess-My-Number) application that generates a number between 1 and 100 and lets the user guess the number.

5. [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/TunsAdrian/Flutter-Google-Course/tree/tic-tac-toe) game with basic animations when tapping a square, also having a highlight effect for the winner.

6. [Basic Phrases](https://github.com/TunsAdrian/Flutter-Google-Course/tree/Basic-Phrases) application with 4 words in Romanian and in Japanese, both having audio pronunciation.

7. [YTS Movies](https://github.com/TunsAdrian/Flutter-Google-Course/tree/YTS-Movies) application that takes a list of movies from https://yts.mx/ and lets the user navigate through the movies, having sorting and filtering options.

8. [YTS Movies with Redux](https://github.com/TunsAdrian/Flutter-Google-Course/tree/YTS-Movies-Redux) is a reworked application made on the same idea as the simple [YTS Movies](https://github.com/TunsAdrian/Flutter-Google-Course/tree/YTS-Movies) application. [Redux architecture](https://blog.novoda.com/introduction-to-redux-in-flutter/) was used on creating this application, while also improving the whole look and user experience.

Currently, on the master branch the [YTS Movies with Redux](https://github.com/TunsAdrian/Flutter-Google-Course/tree/YTS-Movies-Redux) code is present.
